## Hackathon Challenge 2: The Missing Migrant Project
---

### Introduction
We're excited to partner with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to introduce a hackathon challenge centered on the pressing issue of missing migrants. This challenge involves analysing data related to missing and deceased migrantsâ€”a topic that is both sensitive and critical. If you find this subject matter too distressing, we encourage you to consider participating in our Urban Innovation Challenge instead.

### Challenge Overview
This dataset provides vital statistics on missing migrants worldwide, capturing the urgency and human aspects of migration issues. Your challenge is to delve into this data, utilizing your analytical and creative skills to uncover insights and develop innovative solutions that address the challenges faced by migrants. 
This initiative is not just about data analysis; it's a call to action to harness open data for social impact, promoting safer migration policies and practices, and enhancing the understanding of migration dynamics globally. We encourage participants to think innovatively and devise impactful solutions that can contribute to the well-being and safety of migrants around the world.

### Deliverables
- A **Jupyter Notebook** containing your analysis, visualizations, and any models or algorithms developed.
- A **Presentation** summarizing your findings, your proposed solution(s), and their potential impact. Highlight the creativity and data-driven approach behind your project.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Creativity and Innovation**: Originality of your solution and approach to problem-solving.
- **Effective Use of Data**: How well you integrate and analyze the provided datasets to support your solution.
- **Potential Impact**: The feasibility and potential benefits of your solution for Berlin's government or its citizens.
- **Clarity and Persuasiveness**: How effectively you communicate your ideas and findings in both the notebook and presentation.

### Resources
While the challenge is centered around the provided datasets, you are encouraged to enhance your solutions with additional data and resources. The quality of your analysis and the innovation of your solutions will be key to your success. Have a look at the work of the [GMDAC](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/data) and the [Migration-Data-Portal](https://www.migrationdataportal.org/themes/migrant-deaths-and-disappearances) for inspiration. 

### Getting Started
A Jupyter Notebook template is available to help initiate your project. It includes preliminary steps for data loading and exploration, alongside tips for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
